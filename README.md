#### pbplot

This app can be used to plot trace files from Phylobayes runs which is helpful in assessing convergence and mixing of parameters. Input must be at least one, and at most four Phylobayes trace files from chains run with identical parameters.

The app is hosted on shinyapps (limited to 25h of usage/month) https://gerthmicha.shinyapps.io/pbplot/ or can be run locally: 

```R
# Install required libraries
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "gridExtra", "LaplacesDemon", "markdown", "shiny", "shinythemes"), dependencies = TRUE)

# Run Shiny app
library(shiny)
shiny::runGitHub("pbplot","gerthmicha")
```
