Effective sample sizes are calculated using the `ESS` function of [LaplacesDemon](https://github.com/LaplacesDemonR/LaplacesDemon) and will therefore differ from the values calculated with Phylobayes using `tracecomp`. The values for discrepancy between two chains are calculated as described in the [Phylobayes manual](http://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/People/lartillot/www/phylobayes3.3e.pdf) and therefore identical to the values that `tracecomp` generates.
